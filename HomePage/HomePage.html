        <hr das style="border-radius: 16px;"  color="white" size="5" width="350px" >
        <p id="p1">I wanted to say that you are the most special person to me. I appreciate you and adore you so much. I love how you make me happy. I love the way you accept me for me. I love being you with you. I love you so much. Your angelic beauty is one of a kind. Your eyes are magical. Your smile is the cutest and most adorable smile in this universe, It warms and melts my heart. Everything about you is so lovely and amazing. You are an amazing person, Bustan. I love being by your side. And im so grateful for the privilege of being always by your side. I want to be always there for you no matter the distance or time. Your love is my favorite feeling. It's an indescribable feeling. It warms my heart. It makes me feel safe, home.
            <br><br>I want to tell you how much i appreciate you for being such an amazing girlfriend. I love how you care for me and love me. I love how you talk to me whenever you're free. I love how much you miss me. I love them because they go the same way to me. i love talking to you and checking up on you every once in a while. I love spending time with you. I value our time together so much. Our time together is so valuable and vulnerable to me. I genuinely love spending time with you so so much. I love seeing your cute adorable smile, I love seeing your dreamy eyes. I love hearing your pretty voice and laugh. and i just love all of you generally. Nothing will ever stop me from loving you. I know in this generation it's rare to have such a relationship like us. I truly hope and pray that we spend our time forever together. I will never ever leave you or think about leaving you. Because im happy with you. And i truly love you. And absolutely NOTHING will change my mind. No matter what, I will always love the way you look at me with your pretty eyes and i will never get tired of it. No matter what, I will always see your smile as the most adorable smile, And no matter what. I will always see you as the most beautiful that i have laid my eyes own. And it will stay that way forever. And your "flaws" (which dont exist) will not stop my love for you. Your teeth will not stop my love for you nor your body or your eyebags. You're perfect in my eyes. If anything, These "flaws" add to your appeal. It makes me realize that i am with a human just like me. Which makes you more perfect than you already are. I love you so so much my love.
            <br><br>I want to tell you that im extremely proud of you my love, You have went through so much and you're still going through so much. Im proud of you for still holding up. You're the strongest woman i know. Im so so proud of you for not giving up or losing your spirit. My main job is to uplift your spirit. My main job is to cheer you up, My main job is to make you smile and laugh. Because i cant stand seeing you sad my love. I cant stand seeing even a single tear on your face. It will shatter my heart. That's why i try my best to cheer you up by making you paragraphs or buying you gifts. Because i love seeing you happy. I love seeing your smile and sensing your joyful energy. Your smile is truly one of a kind and no smile will have that same effect that yours does to me. I love you so.. so much. Your love makes me want to become the absolute best version of myself and inspires me to be a better person. I improve myself because i want to be the best person for you. Because i want to spend the rest of my life with you. I pray and hope everyday for that. Because thats all i want. It's you. You're all i want. You're my dream.
             Because in your eyes, I see a future. A future that includes me and you. A bright and happy future. I see it in your beautiful eyes. I really really love you. Whenever times get a little tough and i dont see you or hear about you for a while, I truly cant get ahold of myself and i have to view your album on my phone, I view your smile and eyes because i miss seeing them. Or when i hug my pillow i think about you. Whenever im hugging my pillow and i think about you, I hug it tighter. So tight like there's no tomorrow. I imagine that you're falling asleep on my arms while i play with your hair gently.
             I will always be grateful for you love. Your love makes my heart extremely joyful and i love your words of affirmation. They make me realize im special and that i matter to you. Your love is my medicine. It heals me whenever i'm having a bad gloomy day. I get a text from you, I smile a lot and text you back. Its like i forgot i even had a bad day. Thats how much i love you.
             <br><br>I love being called yours, I love being called your boyfriend, I love how you talk about me and make me feel special. I love how kind you are. And i love how comfortable i am with you. I love how you talk about me to your friends. I love you so so much my love. You are truly the love of my life. I have run out of words on describing how beautiful you are. Everything about it just magical. I love it. You are the best person ever. You are worth the most to me. I love you so so much.
             <br><br>Finally i would like to say (again) that i love you SOOOOOO MUCHHHH I LOVE YOU SOO SO SOSO MUCH MY LOVE YOU ARE THE CUTEST GIRL EVERRRR MWAHHH MWAHH I LOVE YOUUUU MWAHHH MWAHH MWAHH MWAH I LOVE YOUUUU SOOO MUCH I LOVE YOUR SMILE I LOVE YOUR EYES I LOVE YOUR NOSE I LOVE EVERYTHING MWAHH

        <p id="p1">You met me at a very strange
             time of my life, I wasnt looking for
              anyone to be with during it. However
               you entered my life. And it changed
                completely. One day i was just going
                 on with my normal day, And my friend
                  told me about you! i was obviously
                   shocked, And i was more shocked when
                    i found out that it was my
                     <ins>CHILDHOOD-CRUSH.</ins> I was
                      more happy than shocked though.
                       My childhood crush likes me?? 
                       Thats unbelievable. And here we are
                        now. I am both the happiest AND the luckiest man alive. Because im so so proud and grateful to call you mine. Because you are the most amazing girlfriend could ever ask for. I will do everything and anything in my power to make you smile, Because you mean the world to me. You are my <ins>everything.</ins> You are the sweetest girl ever, And i love hanging out and spending time with you. I already have a couple date ideas!! (i wont say what they are though muehehehe),
             Bustan, You are truly the love of my life. You are amazing, I love you.

Not to mention that you're so funny you make me smile on the day i hangout with you MORE than in my entire week. Your sense of humor truly never fails to brighten my day. Your charm and positive energy make every moment spent with you a joy. I like how you are not too goofy but also not too serious. Its truly amazing how we click so well together. You make me feel safe and comfortable with you, You make me feel accepted and not feel weird. I love it so much. Your personality is truly amazing, my love.
